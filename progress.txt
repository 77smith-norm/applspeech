2026-02-15T20:12:20Z Refinement: added `status`/`authorize` commands for permissions and model checks, added
`--engine` selection with modern SpeechTranscriber support on macOS 26.0+, and lowered SwiftPM deployment
target to allow tests to run on macOS 15.x (modern APIs are guarded with availability checks). Ran
swift-format and updated prd.json pass statuses/criteria to match the current code.
